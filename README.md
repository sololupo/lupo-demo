# App to create shareable user profiles aggregating referral codes

Check http://ionicframework.com for instructions on setting up ionic on your machine. 

Requires Ionic, Cordova, Nodejs 

Currently setup to use SASS

Auth0 is the authentication system at lupo003.auth0.com
Connected to Colin's Facebook test App and Auth0's dev accounts for the rest.

User data is stored at Auth0 currently - it is able to be integrated with Ruby On Rails, Node.js, MongoDB, etc.


# Login Using Auth0 + Ionic + API 

This is an Ionic project that uses Auth0 for Authentication. 
It's the basic [tabs](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-starter-tabs) example from [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) with the added authentication from Auth0.

This example uses [Refresh Tokens](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular/blob/master/docs/refreshToken.md) so that you will see the Login page only the first time you create the app and then never again.
